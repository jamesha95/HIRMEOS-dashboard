# HIRMEOS-dashboard

This guide will help you deploy a Shiny dashboard that displays book usage metrics. You will need a GitHub account, a Docker account and a ShinyApps.io account.

---

1. You'll need Docker installed. [You can get it here](https://docs.docker.com/install/). A helpful guide to using Docker and R is available [here](https://www.symbolix.com.au/blog-main/r-docker-hello).
2. Next, clone/fork the Github repository.
3. At this stage, the dashboard will require a file named `metrics.csv` to replace to sample data. It should be added to the `data` folder. This `.csv` file should contain at least five named columns:
  * `measure_id` (all measures are listed [here](https://metrics.operas-eu.org/measures); an example is `https://metrics.operas-eu.org/classics-library/sessions/v1`)
  * `timestamp` (as date, formatted as `yyyy-mm-dd`)
  * `work_uri` (as `info:doi:theDOIof/thework.ofinterest`)
  * `country_uri` (as `urn:isso:std:3166:-2:XX` where XX is the 2-letter iso code)
  * `value` (a number, representing number of views/downloads, etc.)
4. From the command line, set your directory to the folder you downloaded from Github. It must contain the `Dockerfile`.
5. Now run `docker build --rm --force-rm -t rstudio/hirmeos .`. Note the full stop. This will build your Docker image, which will contain a stable version of R, RStudio and the tidyverse package. You can check that it worked by running `docker image list`.
6. We want the `data` folder to be available inside the container; that way we can import and export our data easily. To do this, first set `DATA_DIR=${PWD}/data`, then spin up an instance of RStudio by running `docker run -d --rm -p 28787:8787 --name hirmeos-dashboard -e USERID=$UID -e PASSWORD=hirmeos -v $DATA_DIR:/home/rstudio/data rstudio/hirmeos`
7. You can now use RStudio by opening your browser and visiting the address `127.0.0.1:28787`. The username is `rstudio` and the password, as set above, is `hirmeos`. You can set the password to whatever you like.
8. With RStudio now open, there are two optional steps:
 * If your file `metrics.csv` included DOIs but not titles, you can retrieve the titles by running `source(get_metadata.R)` in the console. This will edit your `.csv` and append titles data.
 * In future, if you need altimetric data (like tweets), you will be able to call `source(get_altmetrics.R)` in the console; this will write a new file called `altmetrics.csv`.
 9. Now you're ready to run the app. Still in RStudio (in your browser), open app.R. At the top-right of the script, hit `Run App` (or click the drop-down and select `Run in Window`). You may be prompted that the browser prevented a pop-up. Allow pop-up windows for this address, and check that the app is working normally. If a new page opens but says `Connection refused`, close your browser windows, access `127.0.0.1:28787` in a new window, and try again.
 10. From within the app, you can press `Publish` in the top-right corner. If prompted to download some extra packages to allow this, do so. You will then be guided through the steps to publish the app. Sign into your ShinyApps.io account and follow the prompts to get a token. Once you give RStudio the token, the app will be deployed at your url. Simply visit the url and verify that it works.

And that should be all! To stop the container, go back to the command line and run `docker stop hirmeos-dashboard`.

If you want to allow users to directly upload data to the dashboard, you can do so by setting a desired password in the `secrets` folder -- simply name it `admin_password.csv`. Users will then be able to download/upload data in the Admin tab of the live dashboard.
